For this, we learn about linear models and least squares estimates.\n",

        "\n",
        "We note that \"linear\" here does not refer to lines exclusively, but rather to the fact that the conditional expectation is a linear combination of known quantities. In mathematics, when we multiply each variable by a constant and then add them together, we say we formed a linear combination of the variables. For example, $3x - 4y + 5z$ is a linear combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$. We can also add a constant so $2 + 3x - 4y + 5z$ is also linear combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n",

A somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach we assumed the data was bivariate normal and that the linear model was derived, not assumed. In practice, linear models are just assumed without necessarily assuming normality: the distribution of the $\\varepsilon$s is not specified.  Nevertheless, if your data is bivariate normal, the above linear model holds. If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model.\n",

Because not all sons with fathers of height $x$ are of equal height, we need the term $\\varepsilon$, which explains the remaining variability. This remaining variability includes the mother's genetic effect, environmental factors, and other biological randomness. \n",
        "\n",
        "Given how we wrote the model above, the intercept $\\beta_0$ is not very interpretable as it is the predicted height of a son with a father with no height. Due to regression to the mean, the prediction will usually be a bit larger than 0. To make the slope parameter more interpretable, we can rewrite the model slightly as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \n",
        "Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x_i - \\bar{x}) + \\varepsilon_i, \\, i=1,\\dots,N \n",

        "\n",
        "with $\\bar{x} = 1/N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ the average of the $x$. In this case $\\beta_0$ represents the height when $x_i = \\bar{x}$, which is the height of the son of an average father.\n",

        "### Least Squares Estimates (LSE)\n",
        "\n",
        "For linear models to be useful, we have to estimate the unknown $\\beta$s. The standard approach in science is to find the values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data.
